# Contributing Guidelines

## Branching Rules
- Do NOT push to `main`
- All work must be done on `development` or feature branches

## Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `development`
2. Commit your changes
3. Open a Pull Request to `development`
4. Wait for review

## Merging
- Only the maintainer merges to `main`
- `main` is production-ready only

## Notes
- Keep commits small and clear
- If unsure, ask before major changes
